Despector IntelliJ Integration
==============================

Brings support for [Despector](https://github.com/Deamon5550/Despector), a Java / Kotlin decompilation tool and AST library by
[Nick Cond√© (Deamon5550)](https://github.com/Deamon5550).

Currently doesn't do much, feature set will increase as Despector's stability and feature set also increases. Will eventually
support switching between Java and Kotlin output, using current IntelliJ style for decompiler output (or setting custom out styles),
switching between Despector and Fernflower output, and other stuff that I can come up with.

Building
--------

Build it using the standard Gradle build command: `./gradlew build`
